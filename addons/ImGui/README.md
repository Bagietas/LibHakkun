# ImGui

This addon provides an NVN backend for ImGui. Input events such as Mouse/Keyboard/Gamepad/Touch have to be provided manually. To use, make sure ImGui is cloned into lib/imgui in your repository. See [Hakkun-Example](https://github.com/fruityloops1/Hakkun-Example) for example usage. 
Depends on Nvn.
